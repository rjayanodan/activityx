            <p class="container justify-content-center" style="text-indent:40px">My hobbies are whatching movies in facebook and cooking. And I love being alone especially when I am at home and I like to clean our house every day before my class start. Sometimes if I've got bored I go to my grandmother's house to learn how to cook because my grandma is very good at cooking. She always teaching me how to cook different dishes so that if my parents go to work I am the one will cook for them.

                <p class="container justify-content-center" style="text-indent:40px">My dream in life is simply to graduate, and find a job to help my parents for my sister's education and I want them to experience the good life too because both of my parents didn't graduate with higher degrees because they don't have enough money to go to school.
